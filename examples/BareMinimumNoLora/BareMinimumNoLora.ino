  * This scetch is the bare minimum sketch with: 
  *  - LoRa switched off
  *  - Under voltage protection switched on
  *  - Async port initialised to 115200 b/s with default logging on
  * and is does nothing usefull. That is for you to add...
  *  
  *  The board set up should be:
  *     Generic ESP8266 module
  *     Flash Mode = DIO
  *     Flash Size = Select a 4 MB option. Remember you need twice the space for OTA
  *     And your port, either on the network or on serial
  *
